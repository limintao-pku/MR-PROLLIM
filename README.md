### MR-PROLLIM: Mendelian Randomization with Pleiotropy-Robust Log-Linear Model
##### MR-PROLLIM aims to surmount the problems brought by horizontal pleiotropy (including correlated pleiotropy) and binary outcomes. It adopts the Pleiotropy-RObust Log-LInear Model (PROLLIM) to parameterize the association between traits and uses risk ratio (RR), a collapsible effect measure, to define the causality.
